welcome: |
  Learning circles are free, interest-driven study groups. Every learning circle has a facilitator. The facilitator does not have to be an expert in the subject, so with a little practice and training, anybody can facilitate.

  Whether you want to run a single learning circle or organize dozens across a library system, we are here to help. If you are new to Peer 2 Peer University, start by watching our introductory video.
tagline: Anybody can facilitate a learning circle. Learn more about what facilitator do by reviewing these resources.
